Sets:

Sets differ from lists in several ways, but share several list operations such as len.
They are unordered, which means that they can't be indexed.
They cannot contain duplicate elements.
Due to the way they're stored, it's faster to check whether an item is part of a set, rather than part of a list.
Instead of using append to add to a set, use add.
The method remove removes a specific element from a set; pop removes an arbitrary element.
Sets can be combined using mathematical operations.
The union operator | combines two sets to form a new one containing items in either.
The intersection operator & gets items only in both.
The difference operator - gets items in the first set but not in the second.
The symmetric difference operator ^ gets items in either set, but not both.

Data Structures


As we have seen in the previous lessons, Python supports the following data structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets.

When to use a dictionary:
- When you need a logical association between a key:value pair.
- When you need fast lookup for your data, based on a custom key.
- When your data is being constantly modified. Remember, dictionaries are mutable.

When to use the other types:
- Use lists if you have a collection of data that does not need random access. Try to choose lists when you need a simple, iterable collection that is modified frequently.
- Use a set if you need uniqueness for the elements.
- Use tuples when your data cannot change.




More magic methods for common operators:
__sub__ for -
__mul__ for *
__truediv__ for /
__floordiv__ for //
__mod__ for %
__pow__ for **
__and__ for &
__xor__ for ^
__or__ for |
