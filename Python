Sets:

Sets differ from lists in several ways, but share several list operations such as len.
They are unordered, which means that they can't be indexed.
They cannot contain duplicate elements.
Due to the way they're stored, it's faster to check whether an item is part of a set, rather than part of a list.
Instead of using append to add to a set, use add.
The method remove removes a specific element from a set; pop removes an arbitrary element.
